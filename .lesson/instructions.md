# JavaScript Loops Practice
Complete the following coding problems.  Put your code into the correct spot in index.js. The code for problem 1 goes in the problem1 section.

## Problem 1
Use a `for` loop to return 1 - 10

example: given() -> "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10"

hints: search "js for loop"
#
## Problem 2
Use a `for` loop to return only the even number in 1-10

example: given() -> "2,4,6,8,10"

hints: search "js for loop" and  "js mod"
#
## Problem 3
Use a `while` loop to count how many digits are in a number

example: given(2256) -> 4

example: given(23467529) -> 8

hints: search  "js while loop" and  "js floor" and "js ++"
#
## Problem 4
Use a `while` loop to add up the digits of a number

example: given(2256) -> 15 `(2+2+5+6)`

example: given(11) -> 2 `(1+1)`

hints: search  "js while loop" and  "js floor" and "js +="
#
## Problem 5
use a loop to find the largest number in an array

example: given([2, 45, 3, 67, 34, 567, 34, 345, 123]) -> 567

example: given([2, 99, 3, 67, 34, 23, 34, 67, 3]) -> 99

hints: search  "js for loop" and  "js inequality"
#
## Problem 6
use a loop to return how many letter `e` are in a word

example: given("candy") -> 0

example: given("beetle") -> 3

example: given("beef") -> 2

hints: search "js for", "js ++", "js get one letter of a string"
#
## Problem 7
use a loop to return 10-1

example: given() -> "10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1"
#
## Problem 8
use a loop to change all `e` in a word to `i`

example: given("hello") -> "hillo"

example: given("apple") -> "appli"
#
## Problem 9
use a loop to calculate the factorial of a number

example: given(3) -> 6 `(3*2*1)`

example: given(5) -> 120 `(5*4*3*2*1)`
#
## Problem 10
Use a loop that allows a user to guess a secret number. If they are incorrect tell them higher or lower. If they are correct log correct and end the loop

example: the number is 10

user guesses 5 log `higher guess again`
user guesses 12 log `lower guess again`
user guesses 10 log `correct`

you will have to comment out everything about problem 10 when you want to run the tests. To do this put `//` in front of each line. You can also highlight them all and `ctrl` and `/`
